## Getting Started
Perform the following steps to run this on local

### Dependencies
Following dependencies must be installed.
1. Maven
2. Java 11

   $ git clone https://github.com/nidhi3190/atm-machine.git
2. Once cloned, execute go inside the atm-machine directory and execute
   $ mvn clean install
   This will build the project
3. Once project is build, Copy the property file [https://github.com/nidhi3190/atm-machine/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties]
   in a temp folder and modify the property to put the logs at yours system desired folder
   logging.file.path= path_to_generate_log_file
   example:

   $ java -jar ~/atm-machine/target/atm-machine-1.0.0.jar --spring.config.location=file:///Users/...../application.properties
                path to jar [build in step 2]                                      spring property externalized file.
5. Once the application is up and running, open chrome and put below url in the address bar.
   http://localhost:8080/atm-machine-api.html
   This is swagger API docs.
6. You can try the APIs directly from there or use below curl command to test the application

  6.1 Get list of all accounts [audit feature]

   curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8080/atm/api/account-inventory' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'

  6.2 Get list of atm inventory [audit feature]

   curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://localhost:8080/atm/api/atm-inventory' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'

  6.3 Check balance for a user

   curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/atm/api/balance' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "pin": "1234",
  "userName": "clint_west"
   }'

   6.4 With draw money from ATM.

   curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8080/atm/api/withdraw' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "userName": "clint_west",
  "pin": "1234",
  "withDrawlAmount": 100,
  "useOverDraft": true
  }'


## Code Coverage
This project uses Junit5, mockito and Jacoco to provide the unit testing.
Unit tests are extensively done for service module only as of now.
To view the code coverage use the following commands

$ mvn clean test

or

$ mvn clean install site --offline
